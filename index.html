 <h2>My Life Changing decision</h2>
<p> Living in an area of familiarity can make one comfortable and not excited about change. 
For me that was not the case. As a senior at Islands High School in Savannah, 
I did not want to conform with everyone else and attend a local university
or Georgia Southern just an hour down I-16. </p>
<p> I wanted to break out of my shell and venture out into the unknown world. 
It was not that I was unhappy where I was but I knew that being close to home would not allow me to achieve my goals.
 My senior year, I decided to apply to the <span STYLE="font-style:italic">University of Georgia</span> and I got accepted.
At first I was scared and nervous, but also excited. All my years of hardwork had led up to this very moment. 
<p> Looking back now, it was the greatest decision of my life.
 I have encountered the most amazing people in this world and experienced unimaginable wonders. 
As well as overcame many hardships and challenges.
